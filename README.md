# Inspiration
Nowadays, despite the rapid improvement in the technology field, there are still some populations that do not have full access to the awesome functions brought by the power of technology. For instance, healthcare for rural regions and older demographics. Research has found the population living outside metropolitan statistical areas without any type of health insurance was 9.1%, compared to 8.4% of the population within MSAs. However, we deeply believe healthcare should always be easy to access despite the region, despite the age. So here’s the solution we came up with.

# What it does
ImproveMEnt is a web app that devoted itself to aid you in your recovery from illness or trauma. It is mainly designed for those who struggle with eating disorders and those who are due for physical therapy. ImproveMEnt can be used to help log and track the progress that will help both patients and doctors visualize how far they have come on the road to recovery. In short, Improvement is a web app that will make the whole process of recovery between the patient and the doctor more efficient, more logical, and more direct.

# Structure
We will start with a built-in sign-up and login system, which provides a private and customized account for each of the users, including the patient and the doctor.

# Highlight features
In the mental health tab. It will lead the patient to a health survey which asks the gender, age, feeling of the day, medical history, date, and finally the healthcare clinic of the patient. This will promote the doctor to get to know the patient better while tracking the process of recovery by looking at the patient's answer to the survey.

There is also one of the most important highlights of our project that you will not want to miss. The chat tab, when you click on it. It leads you to a private chat window, where the patient could chat with the doctor at any time, anyplace. Moreover, all the messages will only be seen by the doctor and eliminated thoroughly when the user exits the chat which ultimately protects and respects the user’s privacy.
